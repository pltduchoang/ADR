# **Architectural Decision Record (ADR)** 

## **Title:**

Selection of UI Framework for University Social Networking App 

## **Context:**

We are tasked with choosing a UI framework for developing the user interface of the university social networking app. The selected framework will impact the app's user experience, cross-platform compatibility, and development efficiency. 

## **Decision:**

We have decided to use the React Native UI framework for building the university social networking app's user interface.   

## **Rationale:** 

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:** 
  > React Native excels in providing cross-platform compatibility. It allows developers to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android platforms, ensuring that the app reaches a wider audience without duplicating development efforts.  

**Native-Like User Experience:** 
  > React Native achieves a native-like user experience by using native components and modules. This ensures that the app looks and feels like a native application, which is essential for engaging and satisfying users. 

**Code Reusability:** 
  > React Native promotes code reusability between iOS and Android versions of the app. This reduces development time and simplifies maintenance, as changes and updates can be made more efficiently, minimizing inconsistencies between platforms.  

**Large and Active Community:** 
  > React Native benefits from a robust and active developer community. This community support ensures access to a wide range of resources, including libraries, documentation, and solutions to common development challenges.   

**Performance Optimization:**
  > React Native allows fine-tuning of app performance through native module integration and optimization features. This ensures a smooth and responsive user experience across devices. 

**Cost-Effective Development:**
  > Developing a hybrid app with React Native typically requires a smaller development team compared to building separate native apps for iOS and Android. This reduces labor costs and speeds up development timelines.

**Ecosystem Compatibility:**
  > React Native integrates well with other technologies and frameworks, making it easier to connect the app to required backend services, databases, and APIs. 


## **Consequences:** 

**Community and Library Support:**
  > While React Native has a vibrant community and a wide range of third-party libraries, not all libraries may be well-maintained or offer the same level of support. Developers need to carefully choose libraries and consider long-term maintainability.  

**Debugging Challenges:**
  > Debugging React Native apps can be more challenging compared to traditional web development because you're dealing with both JavaScript and native code. Tools like React Native Debugger can help, but debugging can still be complex.  

**Learning Curve:**
  > While React Native Leverages React concepts, developers with no prior experience in React may face a learning curve when starting with the framework. Additionally, mobile development itself has a learning curve.
